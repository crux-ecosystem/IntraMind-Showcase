## 🎓 Academic Use Case

### Research Paper Section Example

```markdown
## Performance Validation

IntraMind v1.1 demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baseline 
v1.0 implementation (Figure 1). Batch document processing achieved a 3.75x speedup 
(45.0s → 12.0s, p < 0.0001, Welch's t-test), while cached query responses improved 
by 1500x (15.0s → 0.01s) with an 87% cache hit rate [1].

The Neuro-Weaver context optimization algorithm reduced prompt token counts by an 
average of 16.7% (n=100 queries, 95% CI: [15.1%, 18.3%]) while maintaining answer 
quality (F1 score: 0.94 → 0.93, p=0.84, not significant) [2].
