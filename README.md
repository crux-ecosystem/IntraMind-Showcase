IntraMind

To empower institutions and private organizations with secure, offline-first AI systems that make every internal document instantly searchable, understandable, and actionable — without relying on the cloud.

What is IntraMind?

IntraMind is a local intelligence system that transforms an organization’s internal documents — PDFs, Word files, reports, and even scanned papers — into a smart, searchable knowledge network.

It runs securely inside the company’s own network (LAN), ensuring full data privacy while delivering AI-powered answers and insights in real time.
