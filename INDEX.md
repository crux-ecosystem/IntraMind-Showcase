## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I really share this publicly without exposing my model?**  
A: Yes! The .gitignore blocks all sensitive files. Only high-level docs and simulated API are public.

**Q: What if someone wants to use my work commercially?**  
A: The CC BY-NC license prevents that. They must contact you for commercial licensing.

**Q: Should I create a separate private repo?**  
A: Yes, recommended! Keep actual implementation in a private GitHub repo. See SETUP_GUIDE.md.

**Q: What assets do I need before publishing?**  
A: Minimum: logo and one screenshot. See assets/README.md for full list.

**Q: How do I deploy the docs to GitHub Pages?**  
A: GitHub Actions will auto-deploy. Just enable Pages in repo settings.
