## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Publishing)

1. **Add Visual Assets**
   ```bash
   cd public-showcase/assets/
   # Add: intramind-banner.png, logo, screenshots
   ```

2. **Test Demo API**
   ```bash
   cd public-showcase/api/
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python demo_api.py
   # Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

3. **Initialize Git**
   ```bash
   cd public-showcase/
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial: IntraMind v1.1 Public Showcase"
   ```

4. **Create GitHub Repo**
   - Name: `IntraMind` (or `IntraMind-Public`)
   - Visibility: **PUBLIC**
   - No README/LICENSE (we have them)

5. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/crux-ecosystem/IntraMind.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0"
   git push origin v1.1.0
   ```

### After Publishing

6. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Settings → Pages
   - Source: GitHub Actions
   - Docs will auto-deploy on push

7. **Share Publicly**
   - Add to LinkedIn profile
   - Include in resume/portfolio
   - Share with HOD/professors
   - Tweet/post about it

8. **Create Private Repo (Separate)**
   ```bash
   # In your main IntraMind folder (not public-showcase)
   cd ../
   git init
   # Add only actual implementation
   git add components/ data/ main.py config.py
   git commit -m "Private core implementation"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/crux-ecosystem/IntraMind-Core.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
